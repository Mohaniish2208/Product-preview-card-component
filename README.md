## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass
- Custom CSS (Desktop-first)
- CSS Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design using media queries
- Google Fonts (`Fraunces`, `Montserrat`)
- Material Symbols for cart icon (ðŸ›’)

### Workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to implement `letter-spacing` to control the spacing between characters for a more polished look.
- I discovered how using `&:hover` in CSS is actually SCSS syntax â€” not valid in pure CSS unless using a preprocessor like Sass.
- Iâ€™ve started **compartmentalizing my HTML** using clear comment sections (e.g., `<!-- CSS docs -->`, `<!-- Fonts -->`) to keep my codebase organized and readable.
- I practiced making designs responsive and accessible by matching layout and typography across screen sizes as instructed in the challenge brief.

```html
 
  <!-- CSS docs -->
  <link href = "mobile.css" rel = "stylesheet">
  <link href = "desktop.css" rel = "stylesheet">
  
  <!-- Fonts -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fraunces:ital,opsz,wght@0,9..144,100..900;1,9..144,100..900&family=Montserrat:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&family=Outfit:wght@100..900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  
  <!-- Symbols -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Material+Symbols+Outlined:opsz,wght,FILL,GRAD@20..48,100..700,0..1,-50..200&icon_names=shopping_cart" />

```
This is something I have started to pay attention to: compartmentalizing my code using clear comment sections like <!-- CSS docs -->, <!-- Fonts -->, and <!-- Symbols --> to keep my HTML more organized and readable.

```css
.btn{
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 0.7em;
    background-color: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
    border-radius: 0.5em;
    color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    gap: 0.5em;
    &:hover{
        cursor: pointer;
        background-color: hsl(158, 42%, 18%);
        transition: 1s ease-in-out;
    }
}
```
This is something new I learned in this project: how to use &:hover inside a CSS rule to apply hover effects cleanly, which is part of SCSS syntax rather than plain CSS.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Convert this layout into a React component using Styled Components.

- Make it accessible with keyboard navigation and improved ARIA roles.

- Animate the card or button using CSS transitions or keyframes.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:shopping_cart:FILL@0;wght@400;GRAD@0;opsz@24&icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.size=24&icon.color=%231f1f1f) - This helped me for importing fonts.

- [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Symbols+Outlined:shopping_cart:FILL@0;wght@0;GRAD@0;opsz@24&icon.size=24&icon.color=%231f1f1f) - This helped me embed the "Shopping Cart" symbol.
